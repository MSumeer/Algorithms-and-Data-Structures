# Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is the simplest/Naive form of a sorting algorithm.

## **How does Bubble Sort work?**

Given a list of unsorted number we will need to sort these from smallest to largest.

At each index it will check if the next number is larger than the previous, if it is then swap otherwise move to the next index.

After the first set of checks the largest number will be at the end. Repeating this (leaving out last index everytime) will result in a sorted list.

## **Big O notation**
Bubble Sort â†’ $O(n^2)$
