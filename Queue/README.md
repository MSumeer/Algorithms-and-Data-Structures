# Queue

A queue will follow a FIFO (First in first out) approach.

Essentially we will have a pointer called "head" pointing at the start of the queue and a pointer called "tail" pointing at the end of the queue

This will use a singly linked list, a doubly linked list would not be required

## Time Complexity

enqueue/dequeue â†’ $O(1)$
